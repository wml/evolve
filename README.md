A light-weight python-based Linux versioning and deployment mechanism. The genesis of this project was a need to improve our deployment process in the earlier days of Yodle.

This project represents a light-weight approach to managing releases and deployments. It borrows from techniques I've seen implemented in larger organizations, with all of the unneeded bloat and infrastructure requirements stripped out. 

Run install.py to create the necessary user accounts and bootstrap the system.
